# hxJson2
hxJson2 is JSON decoding and encoding library for Haxe. (And it is Haxe 2.x compatible)

## haxe.Json

Since Haxe 2.09 there is a native Json encoding and decoding class in the Haxe standard
library.

This library will still get some support and updates, becaue the Haxe native class and
this library have some differences in their behaviour.
